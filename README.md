Hello! Thank you for reviewing my code.

Generate the executables by running <code>make</code>.

run <code>./server</code> to start the server, process B.

run <code>./client</code> to start the client, process A.

Description: A contacts B, and begins sending cad_mesh.stl to B. B recieves the file, and returns the file to process A. Process A then saves this file to output.stl.

run <code>./test \<inputfile\> \<outputfile\></code> to test if the input and output are exactly the same.

This code was tested on a M1 Mac. Please let me know if there are any issues.
